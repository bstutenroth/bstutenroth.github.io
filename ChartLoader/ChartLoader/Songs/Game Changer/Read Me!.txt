Thank you for downloading my setlist "Game Changer".

Make sure to check out the Song Challenges on the Game Changer spreadsheet at https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Che_2Rfu_Ll_Zzze6fXognLdULqUkzZWct6JYiEjgYg/edit?usp=sharing, if you don't you're missing out on about half of what this setlist has to offer.
Feel free to submit FCs and Challenge Completions to the spreadsheet using the "Submit Everything Here" link on the Hub.
If you have any questions or comments, feel free to message me at RobGHH#5955.

Thanks again,

Rob
